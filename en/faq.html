                            SMART Health Cards are paper or digital versions of your clinical information, such as vaccination history or test results. They allow you to keep a copy of your records on hand and easily share this information with others if you choose.

                            SMART Health Cards may come from any organization that has your clinical information, such as a pharmacy, doctor’s office, or state registry. Here are some of the ways you may get a SMART Health Card from them:

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A paper copy may be mailed to you by the organization after your visit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You may download it from a website or app hosted by the organization and print a copy and/or save it as a file.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You may connect your health records to an app that supports SMART Health Cards.

                            Right now, different organizations have different rules for verifying vaccinations or test results. For example, some countries may have different rules than others. SMART Health Cards are designed so they may be used by any organization that wants to use them. All organizations should provide options for users who don’t have or prefer not to use a SMART Health Card.

                            Sharing your SMART Health Card information is just like sharing a paper copy of immunization records with a school, faxing medical records to a physician’s office, or using your credit card at a restaurant. You should only share your SMART Health Card information with trusted organizations that tell you what they intend to do with your data and/or if they will keep it. If you are not comfortable with the organization seeing the information in your SMART Health Card, you should not share it.

For instance, with iOS 15, Apple is using the SMART Health Cards Framework to allow users to download and store verifiable COVID-19 test result or vaccination records in the Health app, Walmart has announced the creation of a digital wallet for its customers to track their health information built on SMART, and the State of California has announced support for SMART Health Cards by offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccination status.
