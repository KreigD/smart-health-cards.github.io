                            SMART Health Cards are paper or digital versions of your clinical information, such as vaccination history or test results. They allow you to keep a copy of your records on hand and easily share this information with others if you choose.

                            A SMART Health Card has a 2D barcode (QR code) and may look something like this; see image below. Although the other information on your SMART Health Card may vary based on your individual records, most will have the SMART logo.

                            SMART Health Cards may come from any organization that has your clinical information, such as a pharmacy, doctor’s office, or state registry. Here are some of the ways you may get a SMART Health Card from them:

                                <li>
                                    A paper copy may be mailed to you by the organization after your visit.

                                <li>
                                    You may download it from a website or app hosted by the organization and print a copy and/or save it as a file.

                            Right now, different organizations have different rules for verifying vaccinations or test results. For example, some countries may have different rules than others. SMART Health Cards are designed so they may be used by any organization that wants to use them. All organizations should provide options for users who don’t have or prefer not to use a SMART Health Card.

                            Even if you get a SMART Health Card, you do not need to share it with anyone. Choosing to share your information is always in your control and the SMART Health Card should never be your only option when asked to show your vaccination history or test results.

                            You can destroy a paper SMART Health Card and/or delete a digital SMART Health Card at any time. If you change your mind, you may be able to get a copy from the organization that provided your vaccination or test.

                            Sharing your SMART Health Card information is just like sharing a paper copy of immunization records with a school, faxing medical records to a physician’s office, or using your credit card at a restaurant. You should only share your SMART Health Card information with trusted organizations that tell you what they intend to do with your data and/or if they will keep it. If you are not comfortable with the organization seeing the information in your SMART Health Card, you should not share it.

For instance, Apple has adopted SMART Health Cards in its Health App so people can share health data with doctors and family members, Walmart has announced the creation of a digital wallet for its customers to track their health information built on SMART, and the State of California has announced support for SMART Health Cards by offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccination status.
