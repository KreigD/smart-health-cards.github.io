                        SMART Health Cards are paper or digital versions of your clinical information, such as vaccination history or test results. They allow you to keep a copy of your records on hand and share this information with others if you choose.

                        SMART Health Cards come from any organization that has your clinical information, such as a pharmacy, doctor’s office, or state registry. Here are some of the ways you may get a SMART Health Card from them: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A paper copy may be handed to you by the organization at the time of your visit  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A paper copy may be mailed to you by the organization after your visit 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You may download it from a website or app hosted by the organization and print a copy and/or save it as a file 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You may connect your health records to an app that supports SMART Health Cards 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes. The organization with your clinical information may give you a printed paper copy of your SMART Health Card.

                    <p class="answer">
                        No. There should be no fee to get a SMART Health Card. If you decide to share your SMART Health Card with someone, there should be no fee for you or them.

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Right now, different organizations have different rules for verifying vaccinations or test results. For example, some countries may have different rules than others. SMART Health Cards are designed so they may be used by any organization that wants to use them. All organizations should provide options for users who don’t have or prefer not to use a SMART Health Card.

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Even if you get a SMART Health Card, you do not need to share it with anyone. Choosing to share your information is always in your control and the SMART Health Card should never be your only option when asked to show your vaccination history or test results.

                    <p class="answer">
                        You can destroy a paper SMART Health Card and/or delete a digital SMART Health Card at any time. If you change your mind, you may be able to get a copy from the organization that provided your vaccination or test. 
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        You should contact the organization that performed your vaccination or test. They are responsible for the accuracy of your records and these records are the source of the information on your SMART Health Card. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes, as long as you are allowed to. Sharing a SMART Health Card is similar to sharing other medical records in this way.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Your vaccination history and/or test results are stored directly within the SMART Health Card as a 2D barcode (QR code) or file that you control. Sharing your card is completely up to you.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Sharing your SMART Health Card information is just like sharing a paper copy of immunization records to a school, faxing medical records to a physician’s office, or using your credit card at a restaurant. You should only share your SMART Health Card information with trusted organizations that tell you what they intend to do with your data and/or if they will keep it. If you are not comfortable with the organization seeing the information in your SMART Health Card, you should not share it.

                        Just like a normal file, you can save back-ups of your digital SMART Health Card. You may also make copies of paper SMART Health Cards. You may be able to receive a new SMART Health Card from the organization that has your records.

                        Your SMART Health Card can be presented by anyone holding it. However, SMART Health Cards are verified with another form identification, such as a student account in a school system or a driver’s license.

                    <p class="answer">
                        No. The card should only contain your legal name, date of birth, and clinical status–like COVID-19 test results and/or vaccine records.

                    <p class="answer">
                        SMART Health Cards are a way to store your COVID-19 vaccination and/or test history for your personal records and can help you share your status to an organization that asks for it.

                    <p class="answer">
                        SMART Health Cards are free; ready for use; available for organization to use; not associated with any single organization, corporation, or government entity; and were created by a group interested in providing people simple access to their health records.

                    <p class="answer">
                        The immediate goal of SMART Health Cards is to store and share COVID-19-related vaccination and testing status. In the future, you may be able to use them to share and store other health information.
