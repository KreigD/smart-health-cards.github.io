                    <p class="answer">
                        SMART Health Cards are paper or digital versions of your clinical information, such as vaccination history or test results. They allow you to keep a copy of your records on hand and easily share this information with others if you choose.

                    <p class="answer">
                        A SMART Health Card has a 2D barcode (QR code) and may look something like this; see image below. Although the other information on your SMART Health Card may vary based on your individual records, most will have the SMART logo.

                    <p class="answer">
                        You can keep your SMART Health Card as a record of your vaccination history and/or test results. You can also choose to share it with others if you want to show them this information.

                    <p class="answer">
                        SMART Health Cards may come from any organization that has your clinical information, such as a pharmacy, doctor’s office, or state registry. Here are some of the ways you may get a SMART Health Card from them: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A paper copy may be handed to you by the organization at the time of your visit. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A paper copy may be mailed to you by the organization after your visit.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You may download it from a website or app hosted by the organization and print a copy and/or save it as a file.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You may connect your health records to an app that supports SMART Health Cards.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="answer">
                        The organization that has your clinical records may be able to give you one.

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes. The organization with your clinical information may give you a printed paper copy of your SMART Health Card. 
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        No. There should be no fee to get a SMART Health Card. If you decide to share your SMART Health Card with someone, there should be no fee for you or them.  
                    </p>

                        Will my SMART Health Card be accepted everywhere that asks for my COVID-19 vaccination or test status? 
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Right now, different organizations have different rules for verifying vaccinations or test results. For example, some countries may have different rules than others. SMART Health Cards are designed so they may be used by any organization that wants to use them. All organizations should provide options for users who don’t have or prefer not to use a SMART Health Card.

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Even if you get a SMART Health Card, you do not need to share it with anyone. Choosing to share your information is always in your control and the SMART Health Card should never be your only option when asked to show your vaccination history or test results.  
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        You can destroy a paper SMART Health Card and/or delete a digital SMART Health Card at any time. If you change your mind, you may be able to get a copy from the organization that provided your vaccination or test. 
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        You should contact the organization that performed your vaccination or test. They are responsible for the accuracy of your records and these records are the source of the information on your SMART Health Card. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes, as long as you are allowed to. Sharing a SMART Health Card is similar to sharing other medical records in this way.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Your vaccination history and/or test results are stored directly within the SMART Health Card as a 2D barcode (QR code) or file that you control. Sharing your card is completely up to you.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Sharing your SMART Health Card information is just like sharing a paper copy of immunization records with a school, faxing medical records to a physician’s office, or using your credit card at a restaurant. You should only share your SMART Health Card information with trusted organizations that tell you what they intend to do with your data and/or if they will keep it. If you are not comfortable with the organization seeing the information in your SMART Health Card, you should not share it. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="answer">
                        Just like a normal file, you can save back-ups of your digital SMART Health Card. You may also make copies of a paper SMART Health Card. You may be able to receive a new SMART Health Card from the organization that has your records.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Your SMART Health Card can be presented by anyone holding it. However, SMART Health Cards are verified with another form identification, such as a student account in a school system or a driver’s license.

                    <p class="answer">
                        In the USA, no. The card should only contain your legal name, date of birth, and clinical information like test results and/or vaccination history. A SMART Health Card issued in other countries could include commonly used identifiers, depending on local practices or regulations.

                    <p class="answer">
                        SMART Health Cards are a way to store your vaccination history and/or test results for your personal records and can help you easily share your status to an organization that asks for it.
